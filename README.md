# spyglass-api

Spyglass API is a free-to-use REST-ful datasource which can be used to fuel apps in the banano or nano ecosystem.  
There's currently request throttling in place, but the default rates can be increased with the use of an authentication token (todo).

## Stack

The documentation site (`/client`) is written using Angular.

The server (`/server`) is written using ExpressJS and Typescript. 

## Representative Uptime Calculations

### Nano

For Nano, rep uptime is not being calculated since I'm not hosting this service.  The infrastructure is in place but someone else needs to host the service. 

### Banano

For Banano, representative uptime is analyzed & stored for each rep with a weight of >10,000 BAN and is calculated on a daily, weekly, monthly, semi-anually, and yearly basis.  Checks happen every minute & if a representative fails to pass an 'online' check 3 consecutive times, the representative is considered offline until it reappears as online. The results of each check are stored in JSON files (`database/banano/rep-uptime`) & are backed-up automatically each day via an automation script.

For Prinicipal Representatives, I use the Nano RPC `representatives_online` command and aggregate the results from several nodes (`/config/banano`).  For Non-Principal Representives, since these nodes do not rebroadcast votes, they do not appear within the RPC command used for PRs (this is specific to V22).  If a non-PR rep is running some form of node-monitor software & I am peered with them, they will appear as online.  Non-PRs that run node-monitor software can manually have their node added to a list of known representatives so that they appear regardless of peer status.

## Local Development

This API requires some environment setup before it can run.  

1.  Copy `server/.env.template` to a new file `server/.env`.
2.  Replace the placeholder fields.

> This API requires a Nano or Banano node accessible via RPC commands.


To run the server, run `cd server && yarn && yarn start`.

To run the client, run `cd client && yarn && yarn start`.
